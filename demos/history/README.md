# Express demo

Yhub does not handle authentication and authorization. You need to build these
components yourself.

This demo shows how you can integrate yhub in your existing express
application. `./server.js` implements a sample express server that handles auth
by exchanging JWTs with yhub.


## Getting Started

**Start yhub**
```sh
cd yhub
npm start
```

**Start this project**
```sh
cd yhub/demos/auth-express
npm start
```
